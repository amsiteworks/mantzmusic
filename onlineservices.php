    <p>You have captured the best possible performances, the arranging is complete, the editing is transparent and you are now done with the long hours in the studioâ€¦It is time to mix. Give your project what it deserves and have Anthony Mantz professionally mix your music. Simply send your prepared audio files over the internet (you will receive instructions with your quote) and Anthony will take it from there. In just a couple of days you will receive your finished mix ready to go to mastering. See below on how to properly prepare your project for mixdown.</p>

    <p>Now you have finished mixing and you have just one step to go before distribution. Have Anthony Mantz take your finished mixes and master your entire project. This is where the whole album is balanced from song to song and levels are brought up to broadcast standards. You will receive your masters ready to go to your CD replicator or your electronic music retailer. Just add artwork.</p>
