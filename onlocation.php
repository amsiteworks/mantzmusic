    <p>On-location recording is for those seeking a concert recording, or to have a recording session in a non-studio environment. The most basic on-location is a stereo or two-track concert recording. This type of recording is the most appropriate for large acoustic ensembles including wind ensembles, orchestras, and choirs. Starting at $200, this is the most popular recording method for school ensembles and community ensembles.
For a more complex setup, multi-track recording is available up to 16 inputs. This is ideal for taking feeds from the PA or adding spot/solo mics to the ensemble. Please fill out the quote form below for pricing and availability.</p>
