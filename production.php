<h1>Production</h1>
<h2>On-Location Recording</h2>
	<img src="./images/RCCWEFest.jpg" width="275" height="206" alt=""/>
    <p>On-location recording in its most basic form involves two mics out in front of the ensemble capturing a stereo image of the perfomance. The two-track method is ideal for large acoustic ensembles such as wind ensembles, orchestras, and choirs. Additional mics are available up to 16 inputs when more control or flexibility of the sound is desired, or for recording a “plugged-in” band.</p>

<h2>Studio Recording</h2>

    <p>Anthony Mantz is available to engineer your project in any Southern California studio of your choice. Many of the higher end studios do not include a first engineer in the price of the studio. Anthony can take on that role and act as common ground to keep your project organized and running smoothly in today’s world of multiple recording sites and collaboration.</p>
