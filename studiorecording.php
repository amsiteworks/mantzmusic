    <p>So you are ready to start your new recording project and you just found out the studio you choose does not include a first engineer in the price of the studio. Not to worry, Anthony Mantz is available to engineer your project in just about any Southern California studio. You may also save on your overall project expenses with Anthony because he can do editing and the tedious parts of a project on his home setup without paying studio time, you only pay for his time. That way, you donâ€™t get bogged down with fixing timing issues or cleaning up vocal comps while you have a group of musicians on the clock in the studio. Please fill out the quote form below for pricing and availability.</p>
